                <p>So, i am a 17 year old high school student. I have long hair and a lot of style as you can see.
                    I'm a big fan of the United states. I wanna live there especially in LA or Miami. I love the
                    high school life there, the university life there, i love the culture but i dont like that REAL
                    football is not as popular as in europe, also they make great high school parties and frat parties.
                    I've played sports all my life, football when i was young and now im playing volleyball, that's
                    another thing that i like about America, i like high school volleyball there. I also wanna live in
                    Japan, no words about it it's just perfect to the last minute detail.I'm in med school right now and
                    i am a senior
                    so it's a pretty big deal. I'm a straight 5 student but im pretty nervous about the finals in June.
                    Let's talk about my career now. I wanted to become a doctor but growing up i understood that
                    it's too much work for little reward so i started studying Web Designing here at Future Minds
                    Academy.
                    I've decide to study at UBT and i'm gonna be majoring in computer science.
                    I could go on and on about my life, music taste, movies i like, and everything else but i dont wanna
                    bore you. Just enjoy browsing through my first proffesional website :).
