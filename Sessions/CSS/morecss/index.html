            <p class="p3">Worship signifies respect, regard, love and reverence. It also reflects purity,
                    simplicity, honesty and truth. When we work, whether for ourselves, for another, for society or then
                    for the nation, it can be treated as worship if we do it in a similar sentiment. When we consider
                    work as worship it means we perform the work with respect and love. If it involves other people we
                    show the respect and regard to them too. It also means that we work with honesty and purity. We also
                    work with a sense of dedication and commitment when we treat work as worship.</p>
